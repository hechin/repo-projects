	In this program, the user inputs a file and the functions in
	Matrix.java is tested. the two matrices are printed out and
	each one is added transposed or multiplied. the result is then
	printed out on the output file. This program runs in O(n) time
	due to its use of nodes to multiple and subtract instead of
	doing so through a nxn array which would take O(n^2) time.
